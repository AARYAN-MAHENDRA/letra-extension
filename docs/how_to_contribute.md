# üóí What the Fork? (Contributing Guidelines)
> A simple guide on how to contribute to this project, from start to end! Also did you get the pun? I love The Good Place.

Is this your first time contributing to open source? No worries, here's a simple guide to help you out!

If you get stuck on some step, please don't hesitate to ask me. :)

You can contribute in two ways, whichever is more convinient for you:
1. Via Github Website _(no need to download anything!)_
2. Via Local Machine

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Via Github Website
1. Check the **Issues page** to choose what you want to contribute on!
2. You'll need to have a copy of the repository. Click on **Fork** on the upper right hand of the screen.

3. Once the repo is forked, you'll be redirected to the newly created repository. The name of the repository should be: `{{ yourUserName }} / letra-extension` **NOT** `jayehernandez / letra-extension`.
4. You can now make changes to this repo by adding or editing files, depending on what your chosen issue asks you to do.
5. When you're finished which the changes, you'll see that your commit is ahead of the main repository. Like so:

6. Click on **Pull Request** to create a pull request (PR) pointing to this repository. This will allow maintainers of the project to review your code and merge it to the main repository afterwards.
7. You'll be able to choose which branch you'd like to compare with. Make sure you choose the **develop** branch.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Pull requests pointing to master will not be accepted.
8.
