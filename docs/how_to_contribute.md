# üóí What the Fork? (Contributing Guidelines)
> A simple guide on how to contribute to this project, from start to end! Also did you get the pun? I love The Good Place.

Is this your first time contributing to open source? No worries, here's a simple guide to help you out!

If you get stuck on some step, please don't hesitate to ask me. :)

You can contribute in two ways, whichever is more convinient for you:
1. Via Github Website _(no need to download anything!)_
2. Via Local Machine

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Via Github Website
1. Check the Issues page to choose what you want to contribute on!
2. You'll need to have a copy of the repository. Click on **Fork** on the upper right hand of the screen.
3. Once the repo is forked, you'll be redirected to the newly created repository. The name of the repository should be: `{{ yourUserName }} / letra-extension` **NOT** `jayehernandez / letra-extension`.
4. You can now make changes to this repo by adding or editing files, depending on what your chosen issue asks you to do.
5. When you're finished which the changes, you can create a **Pull Request (PR)** pointing to this repository. 
6. Make sure you create the PR to the **develop** branch.
